# delay_spread_net
A simple demonstration of how latent spreads can manifest in measurement layers.


## Things to Include
* Start with Simple Spread in Pixel-Space -> Grid Topology with zero-skips
* A playground for me to tinker with (Fourier) Neural Operators
* Latent Layer and Measurement Layer
  * Discretization as a knob?
